#Consider this as readme file to lazy :/
#The problem statement demands for machine learning approach in scheduleing 
'''for this we can approach the problem by dynamic schedueling and also apply 
patient booking scheduler and data driven scheduler
Such as dental ward mighgt be more demanding in particular month due to 
 factors  '''
#This program is for logic of schedueling dental ward's patients effectively
#This is a working logic only for a week or two 
#There for days might be preferred instead of days 
#This is only backend needs API desiging and all other shits
#The clock to be used should be of twenty four hours format 
''' Health function refers to overall scheduled quality 
Filter function filters the avaliable doctors according to their preferances and 
lectures '''
#If the user can use emacs it would be better as various flow charts and various ideas 
#Could be discussed in the file itself
